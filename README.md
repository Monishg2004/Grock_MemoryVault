# MemoryVault - Preserving Memories Through AI

## The Story Behind MemoryVault

Memories make us who we are. In a world where over **55 million** people live with Alzheimer's disease, watching our loved ones lose their precious memories is heartbreaking. Alzheimer's doesn't just affect memory - it damages the neural connections that define our experiences, relationships, and identity.

MemoryVault was born from a deep understanding of this challenge. Like many families affected by neurodegenerative diseases, we've witnessed firsthand how these conditions can rob people of their cherished memories. Our mission is to help preserve and relive these precious moments using the power of AI.
