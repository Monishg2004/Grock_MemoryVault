## 🔧 How We Used Groclake Tools

MemoryVault leverages **Groclake's VectorLake** and **ModelLake** to efficiently store, retrieve, and process memories. Here's how we utilized these tools:

- 📊 **VectorLake:**
  - 🔄 Converts memory text into vector embeddings for efficient semantic search
  - 💾 Stores memory chunks with metadata for contextual retrieval
  - ⚡ Provides fast and relevant memory retrieval based on user queries

- 🤖 **ModelLake:**
  - 💭 Processes natural language queries to generate conversational responses
  - 💫 Enhances user interaction by making memories more vivid and emotionally engaging
  - 🎯 Ensures context-aware and accurate retrieval of stored memories

## 📈 How Groclake Helps Our Project

The integration of Groclake tools has significantly improved the efficiency and effectiveness of MemoryVault:

- ⚡ **Fast Memory Retrieval:** VectorLake enables quick semantic search
- 🧠 **Contextual Understanding:** ModelLake enhances memory retrieval responses
- 📈 **Scalability:** Handles large volumes of user memories efficiently
- 🤝 **Improved AI Interactions:** Interactive and personalized experience

## 🔄 Workflow

1. 📥 **Memory Storage:**
   - User submits a memory text via the frontend
   - The text is split into chunks using a text splitter
   - Each chunk is embedded as a vector using VectorLake
   - Metadata is assigned, and the memory is stored

2. 🔍 **Memory Retrieval:**
   - User submits a query about a past memory
   - Query is converted into a vector using VectorLake
   - Similarity search performed in the vector database
   - ModelLake generates engaging responses
   - AI-powered image enhances recollection

3. 💫 **Memory Interaction:**
   - Natural and engaging user interactions
   - Continuous system improvement

## 🎯 Future Roadmap
